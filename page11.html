<br></strong>
<br>This critical reflection explores the integration of unconventional materials in sculpture, influenced by Richard Serra’s manipulation of industrial materials and space, and the use of natural scents derived from organic materials such as tea leaves. This discussion focuses on the sensory dimensions of sculpture, challenging traditional views on material permanence and exploring new possibilities in sculpture and architecture.<br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5"><strong>1. The Influence of Richard Serra on My Exploration of Material and Space</strong><br><br>Richard Serra’s works often utilize industrial materials like steel, interacting with space through their grand, weighty presence and requiring viewers to move within the space to perceive the relationship between themselves and the object. In works like Tilted Arc (Image 1) and Torqued Ellipses (Image 2), Serra uses heavy steel to intervene in the viewer’s space, changing the surrounding environment through massive metal structures that compel viewers to walk around or under them, thereby feeling the physical impact of the sculptures on space and perception. Inspired by Serra’s spatial influence, I chose tea leaves as my medium, <strong>a soft contrast to Serra’s steel.</strong> However, I still endeavor to <strong>create a sense of presence and tension within the space, </strong>prompting viewers to navigate around or confront these works, thereby altering their perception of the environment. This choice perhaps reflects a fusion of nature and industrialization, expressing a tension between natural and human interventions.<br><br>&nbsp;Subsequently, I compressed the tea leaves into dense, tangible blocks—tea bricks, symbolizing a transformative journey from organic to industrial. Factories turn natural plant material into rigid bricks, and I wonder if this can serve as a vessel for emotional expression, blending rationality with emotional conveyance. The transition of tea leaves from softness to rigidity contrasts with Serra’s steel works, carrying a delicate, transient beauty. The material characteristics of the tea bricks may reflect social pressures, symbolizing the conflict between nature and industry, and suggesting a confrontation between the natural and the artificial.<br><br>The choice of tea leaves and tea bricks in my work allows me to explore temporality and decay within sculpture, with the placement of the tea brick columns adding spatial significance. The column leans against a window, creating a structure that not only dialogues with the architectural space but also prompts reflection on the endurance of the building’s framework and materials. Sunlight streaming through the window adds another dimension, with shadows moving across the surface of the work as time passes, highlighting its temporality. This interaction with natural light enables viewers to perceive the work’s ephemeral and transformative qualities. Unlike Serra’s enduring steel structures, my tea leaf installation reveals a transient beauty, gradually decomposing and disappearing over time. This choice of material is my reflection on whether art requires permanence. Through the tea leaves, I hope to make viewers aware that the value of art is not always linked to its durability but rather in the contemplation of its fleeting nature.<br><br></p>

The Influence of Sissel Tolaas on the Sensory Dimension</strong><br><br>In  Sissel Tolaas work 'Smell Memory Kit ' (Image 3), she explores how scents can evoke emotions and memories, investigating how the human olfactory experience connects with feelings and recollections. Smell Memory Kit is an installation containing various scent samples, designed to evoke personal memories in viewers, emphasizing the unique impact of smell on memory and emotion. Her approach of encouraging sensory experiences beyond the visual inspired me to consider how my own work could foster similar sensory engagement.<br><br>Incorporating the natural fragrance of tea leaves into my pieces, my work offers an evolving organic scent that changes over time, distinct from Tolaas’ synthetic scents. The aroma of tea leaves not only enhances the atmosphere of the work but also deepens the connection between the viewer and the piece, potentially evoking memories of nature or other associations. In my sculpture exhibition, viewers are observed interacting closely with the installation, breathing in the scent of tea leaves (Image 4). This intimate interaction is something I encourage, breaking down the barrier between the viewer and the artwork. As viewers inhale the natural aroma, they are subtly drawn into the temporal space of the work, sensing the gradual shift and fading of the scent. Through this sensory interaction, I ponder whether this could be a way to reflect on themes of time and transformation—the piece appears static yet is, in some way, continuously changing and will eventually disappear. This olfactory element has led me to a new understanding of sculpture: could it be an evolving presence that embodies the passage of time?<br><br></p>

The Influence of Fred Sandback on Minimalist Exploration of Space and Line</strong><br><br>Fred Sandback’s minimalist philosophy has deeply captivated me. In works like Untitled, colored acrylic yarn and Orange Day-glo corner piece (Images 5 and 6), Sandback uses simple lines to define the volume and boundaries of space. These pieces, created with nothing more than yarn or elastic cord, outline geometric shapes suspended in air, delineating virtual spaces. Through minimal intervention, Sandback’s work encourages viewers to imagine forms and boundaries that do not physically exist, making one realize that space and volume can be expressed and perceived through the barest of elements. This subtle definition of space inspired me to explore how simple materials can suggest spatial presence.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">In my own sculptural works (Image 7), I use tea leaves and tea bricks to create lines and shapes, attempting to imply volume and planes within space. By standing the tea bricks in a vertical column and laying out a rectangular area of tea leaves on the ground, this arrangement not only presents two lines visually but also seeks to blur the boundary between physical presence and virtual space. The combination of tea bricks and tea leaves establishes a balance that is both solid and fragile, suggesting boundaries that are both present and transient, encouraging viewers to imagine the unoccupied spaces and sense the power of “emptiness.” Through these organic materials, I constructed a visual effect of “organic minimalism,” adding depth to minimalist forms with the texture and tactility of natural elements, creating a dialogue with Sandback’s minimalist works.<br><br>In my smaller drawing pieces (Image 8), I further explored the potential of tea leaves as a material for lines, placing them on paper to outline geometric shapes. These tea leaf lines, soft and irregular, add a natural texture that enriches the minimalist form with a tactile quality. These small shapes are not only studies of line and form but also a more intimate exploration of minimalism, echoing Sandback’s spatial suggestion. Through these geometric shapes made from scattered tea leaves, I distilled boundary and spatial relationships on a smaller scale, presenting, in a way, a compact essence of the larger work. I hope this approach guides viewers to perceive the complexity hidden within simplicity, recognizing that space does not need to be filled with heavy material to be sensed. The lines and boundaries in my work are intended to provoke contemplation on space and form, encouraging viewers to appreciate the power of “emptiness” within minimalism and the subtle beauty of nature.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5"><strong>4.The Potential of Food as Building Material: Explorations and Reflections in Tea Sculpture<br></strong><br>The choice of tea bricks as the primary material in my work not only reflects a respect for nature and the material itself but also prompts me to think about the potential of food as a structural material. The accidental exposure of the metal frame in the sculpture, while breaking my initial expectation of its completeness, has led me to further contemplate building materials. Tea bricks, though originating from tea leaves, a daily consumable, exhibit a certain rigidity and strength after being pressed and hardened. This quality makes me wonder why food is typically limited to consumption and short-term existence, rather than being explored for its potential application in construction.<br><br>Gordon Matta-Clark’s work‘ Splitting ’(image10), by deconstructing buildings, encourages us to reevaluate the materiality and structural nature of architecture. In my work, the hardness and form of tea bricks also lead me to question the traditional definition of building materials: must only steel, concrete, and stone be used to construct buildings? Food is often perceived as perishable and fragile, but the hardness and stability of tea bricks challenge this conventional understanding. Through the process of pressing, tea leaves transform from a loose, organic substance into a solid brick, almost asserting that food can indeed serve structural functions. Although tea bricks might decompose over time, their durability in specific conditions makes me ponder whether building materials must be permanent. If architecture can embrace gradual change and decay, can we reconsider the potential of food materials?<br><br>Furthermore, the use of tea bricks as a food material touches on the temporality and cultural aspects of architecture. In different climates and environments, the choice and use of building materials vary over time. To some extent, using “non-traditional” materials like tea bricks in architecture can be seen as a response to time and place—a structure that gradually decomposes is a gentle answer to the environment. The use of tea bricks also raises questions about whether contemporary architecture needs to reconsider its emphasis on “permanence” and “imperishability,” and how material changes can reflect the interaction between a building and its surroundings. Perhaps the gradual decomposition and transformation of organic materials like tea bricks can introduce a new architectural concept: buildings do not need to stand forever; they can be transient, alive, serving a specific function for a certain period, then returning to the natural cycle.<br><br>This idea not only expands the possibilities of building materials but also poses new questions about the ethics and sustainability of architecture. The use of tea bricks as an organic material challenges our traditional perception of construction materials and offers a fresh perspective on the potential for food materials in architecture. Perhaps in the future, we can explore more food-based materials like tea bricks, using them as temporary but functional materials in certain architectural spaces. Through this reflection, I hope to inspire viewers to consider whether the definition of building materials should be limited to “durability” and “indestructibility,” and whether architecture itself needs to engage in a deeper dialogue with its environment and time. This encourages a reflection on how the choice of building materials can embody a symbiotic relationship with nature and culture.<br><br></p>

<br>
<br>The use of tea bricks in my work, unrecognizable to many international viewers, introduces a playful ambiguity that explores form over material specificity. When viewers cannot identify the material as tea, they are invited to engage with the sculpture through its shape alone, allowing form to communicate beyond cultural context. This hidden identity acts as a “code,” revealing layers of meaning only to those with cultural insight, prompting reflection on how cultural knowledge shapes perception. This element of surprise challenges initial assumptions and transforms viewing into a journey of discovery. By blending visibility and invisibility, familiarity and foreignness, the work encourages viewers to question their assumptions about materials and symbols in art.<br><br></p>
