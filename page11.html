When compressed into tea bricks, the transformation represents a collision and fusion between nature and industry. The factory process, which turns soft plants into hard bricks, conveys not only a hard rational characteristic but also embodies emotional tension. This transformation from organic to industrial reflects the contradictory situations of nature in modern society.</div><div><br></div><div>The compression process gives the tea brick rigidity, yet it retains properties of fragility and transience. This texture symbolizes both the compromises and resistances of nature against technological transformations, reflecting the pervasive pressures and anxieties in contemporary society. The form and function of the tea brick carry the flow of time and culture, being both natural and man-made; they represent resilience yet suggest fragility. Through this material, I aim to explore the tensions between nature, technology, and culture, providing the audience with multi-layered reflections.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Audience feedback on the material part:</div><div>What is the sculpture made of?/  I can’t tell this is made from tea. / I can’t see it’s a tea brick.</div><div>This made me reflect on the “hidden identity” of materials.</div><div><br></div><div>In the feedback from the audience, I noticed that t they often could not immediately identify that my works were made from tea bricks. This characteristic of “hidden identity” led me to reconsider the role of materials in art. When the essence of the material is concealed, the focus of the audience shifts to the form, structure, and interaction of the work with the environment, rather than the material itself. This process from concealment to revelation endows the work with multiple layers of interpretation, making the hidden nature of the material a narrative tool, guiding the audience to engage deeply with the artwork during their exploration</div></h1>

For example, her “Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View” reconstitutes the debris from a detonated shed into an aesthetic experience, showing a metaphorical narrative of destruction and reassembly. This helped me realize that the transformation of natural tea leaves into industrialized bricks can serve as a subtle narrative of human alteration and cultural reshaping.</h1>

					<h1 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Richard Serra’s steel sculptures ('Sequence')made me reconsider the possibilities of material purity and open interpretation. His works emphasize the weight, texture, and spatial relations of steel, interacting directly with the environment without explicitly defining the material’s significance. This extreme emphasis on material essence allows the audience to freely interpret the work within various cultural and cognitive contexts. This openness made me realize that the identity of tea bricks does not need to be fully revealed; their concealed nature can also let the audience experience the dynamic resonance of the material with the environment.</h1>

</strong></em><br>
<br>The linear extension formed by stacking tea bricks into a column can, to some extent, be seen as an exploration of the tension between order, stability, and potential fragility. The height of the column and the repetitive stacking create a sense of order on the surface, but the inherent fragility of the tea bricks suggests that this order may not be as solid as it appears and might even conceal a sense of unease. This contrast reveals that the construction of order in industrial society may rely on external support to maintain balance, and the apparent stability might actually harbor underlying uncertainty.
<br>
<br>The structure of the column may also serve as a metaphor for the relationship between individuals and collectives. The stability of the whole depends entirely on the connection of each individual unit, forming a delicate balance: individuals may be functionalized and structured within the collective, losing their independence, or they may support the existence of the whole through mutual connections. This relationship conveys both the interdependent support among individuals and the oppressive role individuals may occupy within the collective order.<br></p>

</em></strong><br>
<br>The tea brick columns and tea strips on the ground in my work are not just physical presences in space; they also serve as mediums for exploring the relationship between lines and space. Through the texture and arrangement of materials, combined with the play of light and shadows from the surrounding environment, they create an experience that merges the real and the virtual. Particularly under the afternoon sunlight streaming through the windows, the shadows of the tea bricks and strips appear as an extension of the sculptures. These dynamic changes in light and shadow not only extend the existence of the objects but also blur the boundaries between the sculpture and its environment, expanding the work from a mere physical presence into a virtual space.
<br>
<br>Standing at the entrance of the exhibition hall, the view through the doorway clearly presents the tea brick columns by the window and the tea strips on the floor. This perspective simplifies their forms into “two lines”—one vertical and one horizontal. This visual effect makes me realize that lines, as the most fundamental form of visual language, can define space and convey an abstract beauty that transcends material. The existence of these lines is not just about geometric shapes; it is about a dynamic relationship formed with the environment and light, allowing viewers to perceive the flow of time within the static.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br></strong></em>
<br>The leaning posture of the tea brick column is a crucial element of its expression. By leaning against the windowsill, the column’s instability evokes reflections on the relationship between balance and reliance. Its dependence on external support raises questions: does this reliance suggest a compromise with its environment or external forces? At the same time, the leaning gesture blurs the boundary between the column and its surroundings, transforming it into a bridge connecting indoor and outdoor spaces. In doing so, the column becomes more than just a physical object, evolving into an open structure that seeks to transcend its inherent limitations<br></p>

					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><strong><em>Light and Shadow: The Dynamic Narrative of Sculpture</em></strong><br><br>The combination of tea brick columns and tea strips is not merely a static display; their interaction with light and shadow creates a dimension of time. The movement of sunlight causes the shadows of the tea bricks and tea strips to continuously extend, shorten, and transform, making it seem as if they are a second form of existence for the works. This dynamic change in light and shadow endows the works with a narrative quality that transcends the material: they not only define boundaries in physical space but also extend the meaning of the pieces within the dimensions of light and shadow.<br>The dynamic changes in light and shadow also make me reflect on the limitations of the work: its visual effects rely heavily on specific temporal and spatial conditions. For instance, when there is insufficient light, does the effect of the “shadow” diminish? Can the audience fully perceive the integrity of the work from just the tea bricks and tea strips alone? These questions make me realize that while light and shadow bring a temporal aspect to the work, they also raise higher demands on the exhibition environment.<br><br><strong><em>Lines as a Language of Space</em></strong><br><br>Through observation and creation, I have come to realize that lines are not only elements that define forms but also crucial mediums for constructing space. The tea brick column serves as a vertical “line,” symbolizing strength and structure, while the tea strips on the floor are horizontal “lines,” extending the breadth and openness of space. The interplay of these two lines in space creates a relationship of contrast and dialogue through light and shadow.
<br>
<br>Compared to the materials themselves, the presence of lines focuses more on an “interventionist” expression. Although the tea bricks and tea strips occupy physical space, their material boundaries are blurred by the extension of light and shadow, prompting viewers to start noticing the interaction of “lines” with the environment. This interaction is not only visual but also an implication within the spatial experience, hinting to the audience to pay attention to the unfilled gaps.<br></p>

In pieces like “Untitled, colored acrylic yarn” and “Orange Day-glo corner piece,” Sandback uses simple yarn or elastic cord to form geometric shapes, defining space in a minimalist form. Although his lines lack physical volume, they can evoke the audience’s perception of invisible spaces, stimulating thoughts on the relationship between the real and the abstract. He uses minimal materials to suggest the volume and boundaries of space, highlighting the unique expressive power of lines as a language of space.
</div><div>Compared to Sandback’s “virtual lines,” my work uses tea bricks and tea strips, which possess stronger materiality and natural properties. However, the tea brick columns and tea strips extend the exploration of “real and virtual” through light and shadow. Light and shadow become a means to complement the lines, extending the work from tangible physical entities into abstract spatial imaginations. This transformation makes me recognize that lines are not just elements of form but also bridges for interaction with the audience.
</div><div>In future creations, I hope to further explore the relationship between lines and light and shadow, maintaining interaction with the audience in various spaces. By engaging with Sandback’s minimalist philosophy, I am clearer about the potential of lines as a language of space—they not only define material boundaries but also imbue the work with open and dynamic narratives.</div><div>

This visual accident captured the audience’s attention and sparked questions about architecture and industrial materials: “The piece looks very industrial. Is the exposed structure at the bottom meant to discuss architecture?” Such inquiries prompted me to reevaluate the significance of the metal framework in the work. It is not merely a functional supporting element but a catalyst for deeper reflections on architecture, materials, and structural concepts.
<div>
</div><div>As the primary material in the work, the rigidity of the tea bricks interacts with the unexpected exposure of the metal framework to form a complex visual and conceptual dialogue. This dialogue is not just about the visibility or concealment of materials but delves deeper into the essence of structure in both architecture and sculpture. The exposure of the framework breaks away from the traditional expectation of material concealment, challenging conventional notions of “completeness” in sculpture and architecture. In architecture, support structures are typically hidden to maintain flawless surfaces, but this unintentional exposure offers a new perspective—one that views architecture as a continuously evolving and dynamic organism.</div></h1>

					<h1 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">This characteristic of the metal framework reminds me of Gordon Matta-Clark’s work Splitting. In this piece, Matta-Clark physically cut through a derelict house to reveal its internal layers and structural details, challenging the traditional functionality and formal integrity of architecture. Through his destructive interventions, he provoked new ways of thinking about space, materials, and the boundaries of architecture. Similarly, the unintentional exposure of the metal framework in my sculpture raises questions about how architectural and sculptural materials jointly define space and experience, exploring the relationship between materiality, form, and the limits of architecture.
<div>
</div><div>Through this exploration, I aim to encourage viewers to reconsider the significance of the support structures that are often hidden in both sculpture and architecture. The exposed framework not only expands our understanding of the physical and conceptual boundaries of architecture but also challenges traditional expectations of form in both disciplines. At the same time, the rigidity and natural decomposition of tea bricks offer a fresh perspective on materiality—building materials do not have to be permanent; they can evolve dynamically and coexist with their environment. This line of thought not only redefines the traditional understanding of architectural materials but also explores the potential of architecture as part of a cultural and ecological system.</div></h1>

Unlike light and structure, scent has a unique penetrative quality, freely traversing the space to establish a deeper connection with the audience. This aroma not only emphasized the natural qualities of the material but also evoked subtle memories and emotions in the viewers.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The flowing nature of the tea scent blurred the physical boundaries of the sculpture, transforming it into a dynamic sensory field. It moved beyond static visual forms, enriching the narrative possibilities of the work and fostering interaction between the sculpture, the environment, and the audience. By incorporating scent, the experience shifted from mere “viewing” to holistic “feeling,” making the work an integral part of the space.</div><br><div>
</div><div>This exploration led me to rethink the relationship between sculpture and space: how scent, as an intangible narrative element, can expand the expressive potential of sculpture, fostering multi-sensory interactions and infusing works with temporal and dynamic storytelling.

</em></strong><div><strong><em>
</em></strong></div><div>In my small-scale drawing works, I experimented with tea leaves as a material for creating lines, arranging them on paper to outline geometric shapes. These tea leaf lines, soft and rich in natural texture, stand in contrast to traditional ink or pencil drawings. They bring an organic and irregular quality to the work, adding tactile richness to minimalist forms. These geometric shapes serve not only as explorations of lines and boundaries but also as studies on the potential of spatial relationships.
</div><div>The natural properties of tea leaves give these lines a unique flexibility, breaking free from the fixed boundaries of traditional visual forms. Instead, they present a dynamic quality of flow and fragmentation. This irregularity evokes a sense of “uncertainty” within space, echoing Frank Sandback’s ideas about the intervention and guidance of lines within spatial environments. The texture and scattered arrangement of tea leaves blur the visual definition of lines, constructing a new exploration of spatial relationships that transcend the need for “filled” spaces.
</div><div>Through these experiments, I aim to highlight the coexistence of complexity and simplicity in my work—demonstrating that space can be perceived not through material density but through subtle interventions of lines that foster interaction with viewers and the surrounding environment. Tea leaves, as a natural material, also encourage me to rethink how the boundaries between the natural and the artificial can be softened, and how the expressive potential of lines can be extended through material qualities. These explorations inspire me to further integrate materials with spatial language in future creations, pushing the dialogue between nature and the man-made, between lines and structures, into new possibilities.</div><div>
