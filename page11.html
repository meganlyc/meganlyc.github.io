<br></strong>
<br>This critical reflection explores the integration of unconventional materials in sculpture, influenced by Richard Serra’s manipulation of industrial materials and space, and the use of natural scents derived from organic materials such as tea leaves. This discussion focuses on the sensory dimensions of sculpture, challenging traditional views on material permanence and exploring new possibilities in sculpture and architecture.<br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5"><strong>1.&nbsp;Material Contrasts and the Dynamics of Leaning in Sculptural Expression</strong><br><br>Exploring the dynamics of leaning and the stark contrasts in material choice offers deep insights into sculptural expression. Richard Serra’s selection of weathering steel for his iconic works ‘Balanced’ and ‘Fulcrum’(image1-1-2) utilizes the material’s robust and enduring qualities, not only for its structural integrity but also for its ability to develop a unique patina that enhances the sculptures’ visual and conceptual depth over time. These sculptures delve into the interactions of space, mass, and time, leveraging the material’s almost eternal nature to make a significant impact on both the physical and psychological experience of public spaces.
<br>
<br>In contrast, my artistic practice incorporates materials like tea leaves and compressed tea bricks, emphasizing transience and natural decay. Unlike Serra’s enduring steel, tea leaves and bricks are fundamentally organic, inherently destined to change and eventually dissipate over time. This choice profoundly influences how viewers perceive the artwork and deepens the exploration of temporal passage and natural cycles. By compressing tea leaves into dense bricks, I not only mimic physical concepts of gravity and balance but also evoke the fragility on the verge of collapse, enriching the dialogue between the artwork and its environment.
<br>
<br>This material backdrop sets the stage for reinterpreting the technique of leaning in my works. The transformation of tea leaves into shaped, dense bricks symbolizes a shift from organic to industrial, maintaining the tea’s natural qualities while achieving a more defined and enduring form. The industrial process of converting natural plant material into hard bricks prompts contemplation of their potential as a medium for conveying both rational and emotional expressions. The transition from the softness of tea leaves to the rigidity of bricks contrasts sharply with Serra’s steel pieces, introducing a fragile, ephemeral beauty. The material characteristics of the tea bricks might reflect societal pressures, symbolizing the conflict between nature and industry and the clash between the natural and the artificial.
<br>
<br>In ‘Balanced’(image1-1) , Serra directly challenges gravity and balance, creating visual instability and dynamic anticipation that sensitizes viewers to the artwork’s potential movement. Similarly, “Fulcrum”(image1-2) uses its towering and leaning form to alter perceptions of the surrounding environment and pathways.
<br>
<br>In my works(image2), the leaning tea bricks not only explore physical form but also express a dialogue between the ephemeral and the eternal. As these bricks lean against windows, the changing sunlight casts shifting shadows, making their inclination a representation of both spatial challenge and temporal perception. The natural qualities of the tea and their displayed inclination guide viewers to experience the piece from multiple angles, reminding us of the ultimate return of all materials to nature.
<br>
<br>Through this approach, leaning in my works emerges as a profound symbol, not just indicating a change in form but reflecting deep philosophical musings on life cycles and natural forces. This creates a stark contrast with Serra’s work, demonstrating how different materials and conceptual approaches can give entirely distinct meanings and sensations to the same sculptural techniques.<br></p>

The Influence of Sissel Tolaas on the Sensory Dimension</strong><br><br>In  Sissel Tolaas work 'Smell Memory Kit ' (Image 3), she explores how scents can evoke emotions and memories, investigating how the human olfactory experience connects with feelings and recollections. Smell Memory Kit is an installation containing various scent samples, designed to evoke personal memories in viewers, emphasizing the unique impact of smell on memory and emotion. Her approach of encouraging sensory experiences beyond the visual inspired me to consider how my own work could foster similar sensory engagement.<br><br>Incorporating the natural fragrance of tea leaves into my pieces, my work offers an evolving organic scent that changes over time, distinct from Tolaas’ synthetic scents. The aroma of tea leaves not only enhances the atmosphere of the work but also deepens the connection between the viewer and the piece, potentially evoking memories of nature or other associations. In my sculpture exhibition, viewers are observed interacting closely with the installation, breathing in the scent of tea leaves (Image 4). This intimate interaction is something I encourage, breaking down the barrier between the viewer and the artwork. As viewers inhale the natural aroma, they are subtly drawn into the temporal space of the work, sensing the gradual shift and fading of the scent. Through this sensory interaction, I ponder whether this could be a way to reflect on themes of time and transformation—the piece appears static yet is, in some way, continuously changing and will eventually disappear. This olfactory element has led me to a new understanding of sculpture: could it be an evolving presence that embodies the passage of time?<br><br></p>

The Influence of Fred Sandback on Minimalist Exploration of Space and Line</strong><br><br>Fred Sandback’s minimalist philosophy has deeply captivated me. In works like Untitled, colored acrylic yarn and Orange Day-glo corner piece (Images 5 and 6), Sandback uses simple lines to define the volume and boundaries of space. These pieces, created with nothing more than yarn or elastic cord, outline geometric shapes suspended in air, delineating virtual spaces. Through minimal intervention, Sandback’s work encourages viewers to imagine forms and boundaries that do not physically exist, making one realize that space and volume can be expressed and perceived through the barest of elements. This subtle definition of space inspired me to explore how simple materials can suggest spatial presence.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">In my own sculptural works (Image 7), I use tea leaves and tea bricks to create lines and shapes, attempting to imply volume and planes within space. By standing the tea bricks in a vertical column and laying out a rectangular area of tea leaves on the ground, this arrangement not only presents two lines visually but also seeks to blur the boundary between physical presence and virtual space. The combination of tea bricks and tea leaves establishes a balance that is both solid and fragile, suggesting boundaries that are both present and transient, encouraging viewers to imagine the unoccupied spaces and sense the power of “emptiness.” Through these organic materials, I constructed a visual effect of “organic minimalism,” adding depth to minimalist forms with the texture and tactility of natural elements, creating a dialogue with Sandback’s minimalist works.<br><br>In my smaller drawing pieces (Image 8), I further explored the potential of tea leaves as a material for lines, placing them on paper to outline geometric shapes. These tea leaf lines, soft and irregular, add a natural texture that enriches the minimalist form with a tactile quality. These small shapes are not only studies of line and form but also a more intimate exploration of minimalism, echoing Sandback’s spatial suggestion. Through these geometric shapes made from scattered tea leaves, I distilled boundary and spatial relationships on a smaller scale, presenting, in a way, a compact essence of the larger work. I hope this approach guides viewers to perceive the complexity hidden within simplicity, recognizing that space does not need to be filled with heavy material to be sensed. The lines and boundaries in my work are intended to provoke contemplation on space and form, encouraging viewers to appreciate the power of “emptiness” within minimalism and the subtle beauty of nature.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5"><strong>4.The Potential of Food as Building Material: Explorations and Reflections in Tea Sculpture<br></strong><br>The choice of tea bricks as the primary material in my work not only reflects a respect for nature and the material itself but also prompts me to think about the potential of food as a structural material. The accidental exposure of the metal frame in the sculpture, while breaking my initial expectation of its completeness, has led me to further contemplate building materials. Tea bricks, though originating from tea leaves, a daily consumable, exhibit a certain rigidity and strength after being pressed and hardened. This quality makes me wonder why food is typically limited to consumption and short-term existence, rather than being explored for its potential application in construction.<br><br>Gordon Matta-Clark’s work‘ Splitting ’(image10), by deconstructing buildings, encourages us to reevaluate the materiality and structural nature of architecture. In my work, the hardness and form of tea bricks also lead me to question the traditional definition of building materials: must only steel, concrete, and stone be used to construct buildings? Food is often perceived as perishable and fragile, but the hardness and stability of tea bricks challenge this conventional understanding. Through the process of pressing, tea leaves transform from a loose, organic substance into a solid brick, almost asserting that food can indeed serve structural functions. Although tea bricks might decompose over time, their durability in specific conditions makes me ponder whether building materials must be permanent. If architecture can embrace gradual change and decay, can we reconsider the potential of food materials?<br><br>Furthermore, the use of tea bricks as a food material touches on the temporality and cultural aspects of architecture. In different climates and environments, the choice and use of building materials vary over time. To some extent, using “non-traditional” materials like tea bricks in architecture can be seen as a response to time and place—a structure that gradually decomposes is a gentle answer to the environment. The use of tea bricks also raises questions about whether contemporary architecture needs to reconsider its emphasis on “permanence” and “imperishability,” and how material changes can reflect the interaction between a building and its surroundings. Perhaps the gradual decomposition and transformation of organic materials like tea bricks can introduce a new architectural concept: buildings do not need to stand forever; they can be transient, alive, serving a specific function for a certain period, then returning to the natural cycle.<br><br>This idea not only expands the possibilities of building materials but also poses new questions about the ethics and sustainability of architecture. The use of tea bricks as an organic material challenges our traditional perception of construction materials and offers a fresh perspective on the potential for food materials in architecture. Perhaps in the future, we can explore more food-based materials like tea bricks, using them as temporary but functional materials in certain architectural spaces. Through this reflection, I hope to inspire viewers to consider whether the definition of building materials should be limited to “durability” and “indestructibility,” and whether architecture itself needs to engage in a deeper dialogue with its environment and time. This encourages a reflection on how the choice of building materials can embody a symbiotic relationship with nature and culture.<br><br></p>

Her installations, A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby and African Boy Attendant(image11&amp;12), use sugar not only to evoke a sense of sweetness but also to reveal the hidden history of slavery and colonial exploitation behind the sugar industry. These works compel viewers to confront the complex historical narratives that lie beneath the surface.<br><br>In“ A Subtlety”(image11), or the Marvelous Sugar Baby, Walker crafted a massive sphinx-like figure of a Black woman in a submissive pose, made entirely of sugar, and placed it inside an abandoned Domino sugar factory in Brooklyn. This colossal statue merges ancient and colonial imagery: its sphinx-like shape evokes the history of Egypt and Africa, while the material—sugar—connects it to the Caribbean and American slave trade. The sweetness of the sugar starkly contrasts with the brutal realities of its production history, especially during the times when slaves were forced to labor in sugar plantations. By situating this figure within an industrial production scene, Walker emphasizes the exploitation and commodification of Black bodies, revealing how these bodies were used to satisfy the Western society’s sweet cravings. The exaggerated and sensuous form of the statue further critiques the sexualization and objectification of Black women, forcing viewers to face the uncomfortable legacy of colonialism and racial exploitation.<br><br>Through the depiction in African Boy Attendant(image12),, Walker delves into similar themes with the representation of a young Black boy serving as an attendant—a common role for Black individuals in colonial and aristocratic settings. This submissive portrayal allows Walker to critique the objectification and dehumanization faced by Black people, who were often relegated to servile roles to satisfy the demands of the upper class. The boy’s youthful and innocent demeanor contrasts starkly with the severity of his circumstances, highlighting the loss of childhood innocence to servitude and exploitation. This powerful image exposes the layers of pain and oppression that history frequently masks, urging viewers to consider the systemic abuse inherent in colonial structures. Moreover, the use of sugar in the artwork underscores the bitter link between its sweet taste and the exploitation it represents, reminding viewers of how history has turned human lives into consumable symbols for the privileged<br><br>A Subtlety and African Boy Attendant (image11&amp;12),together form a powerful critique of how Black bodies have been used and commodified throughout history. Walker employs sugar—a product with a history of exploitation—as a metaphor to expose these disturbing truths. By revealing these unsettling realities within the context of everyday commodities, Walker challenges viewers to reexamine the overlooked histories that they might take for granted.<br><br>In my own work, although I also use edible materials—tea leaves—my approach differs from Walker’s. Rather than focusing on revealing histories of exploitation or colonial oppression, I explore the themes of cultural exchange and movement to some extent through the historical significance of tea leaves along ancient trade routes. By reshaping tea bricks—once used as a form of currency—into artistic media, I transform a familiar everyday item into a symbol of historical and cultural interconnections. This transformation not only challenges viewers to reconsider the traditional uses and meanings of materials but also symbolically represents the flow and adaptation of cultures.<br><br>Moreover, in this exhibition, the use of tea as an unconventional medium has sparked curiosity among viewers. Many did not realize that the sculpture was made of tea until they read the display label or talked with me. When this truth is revealed, they often express surprise. This reaction is particularly interesting because the hidden nature of the material serves as a “code” in the artwork—only when this code is deciphered can viewers truly begin to contemplate the deeper meanings and historical stories behind the material. This experience not only demonstrates the power of art to change perceptions but also encourages viewers to delve deeper into the cultural narratives embedded in everyday objects. Just like Kara Walker uses sugar to unveil its colonial and slavery past, I use the hidden identity of tea leaves to inspire reflections on its cultural and historical significance.<br><br>However, the ambiguity of tea as a sculptural material adds a playful sense of mystery, prompting viewers to focus more on the form of the sculpture rather than the material itself before its identity is revealed. This experience highlights the artistic expression of form and reduces reliance on background knowledge of the material, allowing the artwork to interact with viewers in a way that transcends specific cultural backgrounds. My works do not compel viewers to uncover every cultural or historical significance; instead, they appreciate the immediate visual and conceptual communication. By combining elements of visibility and invisibility, familiarity and unfamiliarity, I aim to inspire viewers to reconsider their preconceived notions about materials and symbols in art, revealing the stories and histories that shape our cultural understanding<br><br></p>
