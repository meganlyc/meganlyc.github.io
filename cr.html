                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In an invisible state, Sui Jianguo grasped the clay sculpture with both hands and then used 3D printing technology to imitate the real clay material, and finally achieved a sculpture that simulated the empty state of the hand.<br><br>After he uses 3D scanning technology and 3D printing technology to enlarge the clay blocks he arbitrarily kneads, the audience can clearly see every mark of the soil and bump on the sculpture, and clearly observe every trace of Sui Jianguo's palm print.<br><br>Sui Jianguo's action of enlarging clay sculptures through 3d technology impressed me deeply and influenced my creation to a great extent. It's a combination of new technology and old art that leads to a new view.<br>And I find that the precision of 3D technology, its infinite ability to capture and restore details, cannot be questioned. Sui Jianguo said that when he was doing the work, scanning the small clay sculpture and then storing the 3D data in the computer, and then directly engraving, at this time the computer engraving will not lose any data, it carved out the sculpture, people can not doubt it with the original (hands) that the disappeared space between the relationship. At this point, you have the use of new technology, but also to get the classic feeling of the original sculpture material.<br><br>In addition to accurately restoring the enlarged texture, its cold gray appearance and fragile hollow texture, as well as the technological appearance of 3D printing, help to resolve the privacy of the hand pattern and the body, strengthen the virtual and universal technological means and materials of the work and the difference between the body, and achieve the maximum unfamiliar effect. However, the touch brought by defamiliarization makes people think about these sculptures as strange objects that they know for the first time. The strangeness drives the viewer to look closely at the sculptures and discover the texture that pervades the surface of the works.<br><br>The irreplaceability of 3d printing's magnified behavior also lies in the fact that it allows the mud to affect the surrounding space well. As Sui Jianguo said, "When a person sees this lump of mud or this piece of plaster, he will think that he is seeing this lump of mud and this piece of plaster itself, and will not think that he is seeing the space formed by my hand in the movement." This is because before scaling up, the mud mass is at a scale that can be grasped, and people are accustomed to this scale, and think that it is clear, without unknown factors. As a result, the mud mass cannot mobilize the human body to perceive space, and the body plays a key role in perception, and a completely disembodied perceiver will not have spatial coordinates. Enlarging the mud not only enlarges the volume of the sculpture, but also enlarges the space in which the sculpture is located and the audience's perception of the space. At the same time, it also means that the "emptiness in the hand" is multiplied and the audience is doubled. Only when the emptiness in the hand is enlarged to a scale that can accommodate the body to enter, does the viewer gradually realize that these sculptures are the embodiment of the emptiness in the hand. Thus the viewer seems to have come to the inside of the palm of the original hand, and the emptiness of the hand is on the same level. The boundary between inside and outside, the appearance of emptiness and reality, the limits of time and space, are broken one by one. The audience became closed and pinched<br>Those present at the site of the mud saw and witnessed the moment when the emptiness took shape in their hands.<br><br>Finally, the hand pattern shown on the surface of the sculpture after enlarging is not static, but the trace left by the body movement. In addition to the obvious pattern, you can also see the broken edges and particles left by the extrusion of mud or plaster. Sui Jianguo said that each of these sculptures has a unique "birth certificate" : "Each of the 'emptiness' produced from my hands, all the hand prints, superimposes, tears and other impressions carried are absolutely indispensable." Because only these details can prove that this is the mud that I grasp at a certain moment, under a certain force. They are all the details of the rendezvous of time and space from which 'that void' was created, the birth certificate of 'that void'." (The "birth certificate" is the hand print, overlying, tearing and other impressions carried by the sculpture, and its essence is also an index, an index of the emptiness in the hand.) I was deeply attracted, and I want to try to add his working style to the sculpture creation to shape the sculpture.</p>

The basic elements of a picture consist of lines or points. He combines cobalt blue or orange mineral powder with dimethyl glue (the traditional animal skin glue used in East Asian silk painting) to create a matte pigment with visual layers of texture; Take the pen to dip, on the natural color (most of the time painted with translucent yellow oil) background in a strict rule of layer by layer printing, every time exhausted, repeat the operation until the picture is complete;<br><br><em>From Point</em> to point, it is painted with the same brushstroke unit combined with the accumulation of time, and printed one by one, the canvas absorbs the pigment uniformly and appropriately, and the brush print changes from thick to light and from deep to shallow, just like the disappearance of life. Lee Ufan carefully controlled the amount of each brush of paint, and deliberately made the color disappear, just as he wanted to remove the external reality, wash the mind to the ultimate void, and get closer to nature. The penetration of the paint is surprisingly brisk under control, reflecting Lee's rigor and focus on self-cultivation, and embodying the same mental law as Eastern calligraphic calligraphy - to open Qi, the universal life force, by transmitting the essence of our being alive.<br><br><em>From Line</em> is twenty-nine blue lines vertically arranged on the entire rectangular canvas, each stroke extends almost to the entire height of the canvas, and the thickness of the paint gradually becomes lighter from thick. He laid blank canvases flat on the studio floor (perhaps because, Mr. Lee said in an interview, he grew up in the countryside and was often "facing the land"), held his brush vertically, and slowly released a load of monochrome paint from one end to the other.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In the early 1990s, Lee completed Correspondence by lengthening the strokes and shortening the tracks. The pigment remains in this work can be seen either as a "fat" rectangular dot or as a "low flat" short line. They start from different positions, walk and settle in different directions, and are no longer side by side or overlapping with each other, and respond to each other in the same heaven and earth with a "safe distance" that does not disturb each other;
<br>
<br>The "separated" dots not only make the characteristics of the pigment more prominent in each stroke, but also make the viewer pay more attention to the sensory shock brought by "white space". This concept has been related to the "from line and from point" of Lee Yuhwan's creation from the beginning -- the transitional white space of the pigment used to be in the middle of a stroke. Now a visual mapping between a solid color paint block and a non-canvas surface:
<br>
<br>The white space is always a carefully conceived layout, he said: "When thinking about the work on a canvas, it is necessary to create a vitality, or interaction, in the place of painting, which is generated by the relationship between painting and not painting." My white space is created by the parts of the painting to establish an overall relationship and thus create a larger space. For example, in the act of ringing a bell, as it travels, the whole relationship between the visible substance of the bell and the invisible sound wave is what I call blank." This is also an important concept of "white space" in his works. In addition to the blank space, the repeated movement of painting, one stroke at a time, is the process of observing his own feelings - meditation. In this blank canvas - infinite space, he does not express intensely, but empties his mind by constantly repeating abstract patterns that do not express anything, painting in a highly controlled manner. In this process, he abandoned the desire for profit, integrated himself with time, matter and space, entered the mind with the environment, and entered the creation of the non-interest and opposition relationship with foreign things. The brushstrokes and color blocks finally became the products of his almost meditative meditation, which is his pursuit of the fundamental and also the philosophical expression of the essence of the Korean monochrome painting school. Li Yuhuan's exploration and research on the white space made me think involuntarily. I hope that I can add the understanding and thinking of the white space in my future works, and make the white space become a part of the works.</p>

					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">2.GuoXi<br>Guo Xi, a painter from Song Dynasty, suggested in “Mountains have Three Distances” that perception is a distillation of the mind's intermingling with the realm through the practical observation of the landscape. He suggested that the landscape could remove mundane emotions, even though the landscape itself is just a material object. In order to break this barrier, Guo Xi proposes the concept of “farness” to extend the shape of the landscape. The viewer's eye is inevitably shifted to his imagination, thus underlining the “nothingness” in the distance.It can also be found through research that the space of Taihu stone and the space of Chinese painting have a very large similarity.&nbsp;<br></p>
