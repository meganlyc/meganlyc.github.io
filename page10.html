</strong><br> 
<br>The "Baldock, Pope, Zahle" exhibition profoundly influenced my work, especially in how I use materials and textures. Pope’s work in this exhibition explores the intersection of various materials like glass, textiles, and ceramics, each piece narrating personal stories and experiences.
<br>
<br>Inspired by Pope's approach, I incorporated diverse materials into my sculpture, seen in the first image. For example, I used a ceramic base, a papier-mâché second layer, and various other materials for the upper sections. This mix of textures invites viewers to engage more deeply with the piece, adding a rich, tactile element.
<br>
<br>Pope’s work is rich with themes and narratives, which pushed me to add symbolic layers to my sculpture. Each part of my piece reflects different aspects of transformation and growth. For instance, the second layer of papier-mâché gives a sense of evolution, while the vibrant colors capture the lively and complex nature of modern life.
<br>
<br>I also love the playful and whimsical feel of Pope’s work, which significantly influenced my sculpture. The bright colors and bold shapes in my piece are a direct nod to Pope’s fun approach. This playful touch makes my sculpture more engaging and eye-catching, inviting viewers to explore and interact with it.</p>

					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Seeing Matthew Darbyshire's Modern Life Show online, viewing his installations, and checking out the Gallery's interview with him, it turns out that his goal is to create sculptures that look like consumer products, and discusses how they make many of the elements that mimic the consumer product appearance of “fresh” elements. This approach involves using a variety of materials and techniques to make the sculptures resemble ready-made goods available on the street or online. He emphasized the importance of making the objects look authentic and believable, even mentioning that if the objects cannot be found, they are made from scratch to achieve the desired effect of novelty and modern consumerism.<br><br>Textual elaboration of sources from:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/6tByDVgiBYM?si=l46DpzI9SWZnwwKf" class="text-primary">https://youtu.be/6tByDVgiBYM?si=l46DpzI9SWZnwwKf</a><br>Matthew Darbyshire interview | An Exhibition for Modern Living | Manchester Art Gallery | 2015<a href="https://youtu.be/6tByDVgiBYM?si=l46DpzI9SWZnwwKf" class="text-primary"><br></a><br><br>Inspired by Darbyshire, I undertook my own research by visiting multiple furniture stores. This hands-on exploration helped me understand how objects are presented in commercial spaces to entice buyers. Observing the meticulous staging in these stores, I started to think about the role of context and presentation in shaping our perception of art and everyday objects.<br><br><br></p>

I added a bulb to it and named it “Handmade Fusion Lamp” online, with the aim of blurring the line between art and commodity. The description on the website emphasized its unique craftsmanship and aesthetic appeal, highlighting its potential as a home decor item. This online presentation contrasts with my view of the work as pure sculpture, which aims to be appreciated for its artistic value rather than its functionality.<br><br>The project emphasizes the complex relationship between photography and sculpture. Online, my lamps exist as a series of photographs and descriptions, detached from the physical object. The shift from tangible object to digital image changes the way viewers perceive and engage with the work. While the online descriptions focus on its decorative and utilitarian qualities, my personal interpretation focuses on its sculptural qualities and the artistic process behind it<br><br>In reflecting on my work, I realize how context and expression affect our understanding of art. The fact that my sculptures are viewed as commodities online and as separate artworks in the gallery reveals the multifaceted nature of artistic expression. This exploration deepened my understanding of the interplay between visual art and physical space, much like Darby Hill's installations, and inspired me to continue experimenting with how art exists and is interpreted in different environments. In the final stages of making this sculpture, I realized that I was really interested in functional objects. This led me to turn or see this sculpture as a lamp, something that could be sold in an analog store.<br></p>

This powerful piece has profoundly influenced my own artistic practice.<br><br>Seeing the Haida totem pole influenced my work in several ways:<br><br>First, the vertically stacked composition of the totem pole inspired me to experiment with a similar approach. My sculptures layer different elements to create a sense of hierarchy and narrative. The base, center and top all have distinct sections that combine to tell a coherent story, just like the totem pole.<br><br>Secondly, the rich symbolism in the Haida totem pole made me think about how to incorporate deeper meanings into my own work. For example, the black cat’s head at the top of my sculpture evokes a sense of mystery and curiosity. Each part of my sculpture carries its own significance, helping to create a narrative that invites viewers to explore its layers.<br><br>The bold use of colors in the Haida totem pole—reds, blacks, and blues—inspired me to use bright, contrasting colors in my sculpture. These vibrant colors not only make the sculpture visually striking but also help highlight different parts of the piece.<br><br>The way the Haida totem pole combines human and animal figures influenced how I approached my own work. I blended animalistic features, like the black cat’s head, with more abstract and surreal elements. This mix creates a dynamic and engaging piece that captures the viewer’s interest.<br><br>The dynamic shapes and expressive carvings of the totem pole influenced the way I shaped my sculpture. I aimed to capture a sense of movement and emotion, using exaggerated forms and playful extensions to create a lively, energetic composition.<br><br>Finally, I have in mind cultural respect and artistic integrity. My work draws on the aesthetic and symbolic elements of the totem pole, while being My work draws on the aesthetic and symbolic elements of the totem pole, while being mindful of respecting cultural heritage.

					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7"><br>In the British Museum North America gallery, I saw some other sculptures that prompted my interest in the masks and feet of the figures.<br><br>One of the most noticeable was the use of masks and character expressions. The museum pieces often depicted faces with exaggerated features and vivid expressions. This inspired me to think about the role of masks in my own work. In my cat sculpture, the mask adds a layer of mystery and depth. It’s not just a covering but an integral part of the character’s identity, much like the masks I saw at the museum. This realization helped me understand how masks can transform and enhance a character, giving it a unique personality.<br><br>Observing the feet of various sculptures at the museum, I found them particularly intriguing. The way feet are carved can convey a lot about movement and stance. In my sculpture, the feet are chunky and dotted, giving them a playful and animalistic feel. This ties back to natural forms and connects with the way animals are often depicted in traditional sculptures. By giving my sculpture distinctive feet, I aimed to root it in a sense of the natural and the fantastical.<br></p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7"><br>My work is influenced significantly by Bauhaus aesthetics. The Bauhaus emphasis on geometric forms is evident in my sculpture’s design, which incorporates clear, structured shapes similar to the geometric patterns seen in Bauhaus graphics. The balance between functionality and artistic expression in Bauhaus designs is mirrored in my piece’s form, creating an object that is both practical and visually striking.<br><br>In terms of practicality, my sculpture draws inspiration from Bauhaus furniture. Bauhaus designs are known for their functional and minimalist approach, where every element serves a purpose without unnecessary ornamentation. This principle guided my thought process in ensuring that my sculpture is not only an art piece but also a functional object. The clean lines and efficient use of materials in Bauhaus furniture influenced how I approached the structural integrity and usability of my sculpture.<br><br>Additionally, the costumes created in the Bauhaus theatre productions, such as those designed by Oskar Schlemmer, inspired me to think beyond traditional sculpture. The playful and abstract forms of Bauhaus costumes opened up new possibilities for incorporating performative elements into my work. This influence has led me to consider future projects that blend sculpture with wearable art, creating pieces that can be both displayed and interacted with in a performative context.<br><br>The impact of Bauhaus extends to how I present my work as well. Inspired by the movement’s holistic approach to art and design, I am considering how to animate my sculpture using holographic projection, transforming it into a dynamic, interactive piece. This approach not only pays homage to the Bauhaus tradition of merging art and technology but also engages viewers in a new, immersive experience.<br><br>Overall, the Bauhaus movement’s integration of art, design, and functionality has profoundly impacted my approach to sculpture. It has encouraged me to create pieces that are both aesthetically pleasing and practical, with the potential for performance art integration. This exploration continues to shape my work, pushing the boundaries of traditional sculpture and inviting new ways of interaction and engagement.</p>
